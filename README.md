## Overview

### <b id="the-challenge">The challenge</b>
<br/>
Analyze the execution of Government expenses, data source from the Transparency Portal, referring to data from Jan/22 to Mar/22.
<br/>
At the end of the challenge, you will have to send the data dictionary, the dimensional diagram of the applied modeling and the jupyter notebook.
<br/><br/>

### <b id="project-composition">Project Composition</b>
1- DW_09_CHALLENGE_DICIONARIO_DADOS.pdf
<br/>
A document that contains metaata about the data within a database. It serves as a comprehensive reference guide that provides detailed information about the structure, organization and meaning of the data elements stored int he system.
<br/><br/>

2- DW_09_CHALLENGE_DIAGRAMA.pdf
<br/>
Dimensional diagram used to organize and represent data for analytics and reporting purposes.
<br/><br/>

3- DESAFIO_ALUNA09.ipynb
<br/>
Jupyter notebook containing the solution to the challenge.
<br/>
Developed the process of extracting raw data from sources, transforming it into a usable format, including cleaning, filtering, aggregating the data and loading it into a destination where it can be accessed and analyzed effectively.

## <b id="my-process">My Process</b>

### <b id="built-with">Built with</b>
- The project was developed using the Azure environment and T-SQL im Jupyter Notebook
- A log table was created to assist in the development process and store error messages incase of failure.
<br/>

### <b id="what-i-learned">What I learned</b>
- This project was my first endeavor in the field of data engineering, and the entire ETL process was a completely new experience for me.
- With the correction, I understood how the time dimension works and realized that I failed to apply it in this project.
- In the table "UnidadeGestora", there were records where the same code had different names. To handle this, I created a temporary table, grouping the codes into partitions and sorting them alphabetically. Then, I selected the first record from each partition.
